# Cannon's Algorithm Visualization

This is a visualization of Cannon's algorithm using TSGL. It will demonstrate for students familiar with parallel programming the mechanisms of Cannon's algorithm in a way that empowers them to interact with it and understand its strengths and limitations with the movement of the data.

Requires installation of TSGL first: https://github.com/calvin-cs/tsgl

After compiling cannonVis.cpp using the Makefile provided, cannonVis can be run using ./cannonVis <grid size>

The grid size is the dimensions of the square matrices to show performing the algorithm.
